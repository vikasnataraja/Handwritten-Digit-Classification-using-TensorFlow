## Handwritten-Digit-Classification-using-TensorFlow

This repo is a simple python script that teaches beginners about deep learning. I used this Jupyter notebook/python script to teach a class last year about the awesomeness of CNNs. It builds a simple convolutional neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Originally created by [@Aymeric Damien](https://github.com/aymericdamien), modified and updated with plots and descriptions.

Instructions on how to run this coming soon.
